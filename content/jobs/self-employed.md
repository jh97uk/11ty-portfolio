I started my career freelancing with the innovation team of a local software firm to develop software for major car manufacturers. I helped develop a prototype React web app which integrated with established intranet APIs at factories to provide factory employees real-time data on equipment failure.

During the pandemic, I began my consulting and teaching practise. Teaching refined my mentorship skills, guiding students in best practises and fostering their growth, while my consultancy work prepared me for developing high quality, production-ready solutions across varied settings and industries alongside multidisciplinary teams.
