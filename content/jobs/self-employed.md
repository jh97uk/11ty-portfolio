My freelancing career started with the innovation team at a local firm, developing software for major car manufacturers. I developed a prototype React app that integrated with established intranet APIs, providing factory staff real-time data on equipment failure.

I began my teaching and consulting practice in late 2020. My 1000+ hours in teaching have refined my mentorship skills and strengthened my communication. I guided students in best practices, fostered their growth, and helped many land their first developer jobs.

My consultancy work prepared me for developing high quality, production-ready solutions across varied industries alongside multidisciplinary teams. It taught me a lot about working with established code bases, and working with developers from a range of backgrounds and skill levels.

More recently, I've been supporting a client build their product. From consulting on security, infrastructure and dev ops, to pair programming and contributing my own code to their product... I've collaborated with the lead developer and other team members to deliver a product their customers can depend on.
